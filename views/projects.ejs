                <img class="project-img" src="/images/vba_emails.png" alt="VBA Project Image">
                <p>This project consisted on senditing auditing emails to external law firms. Braskem had 84 law firms representing different types of law suits. Each type of law suit had a different email structure and template. The process was executed by different members of the organization which would take 4 to 5 hours to be completed.<br>Therefore, I created a painel with 6 different buttons (each representing a cicle of the auditing process), and successfully sent all emails in 10 seconds. This project resulted on a 95% efficiency and 100% accuracy.</p>

                <p>Me and my colleague (Sumer Khan) developed a Node JS web application for managing a hospital database. This application had a linked database (MongoDB), User Authentication, three different access profiles, and CRUD functionality. The application was developed using GItHub.<br><b>Click on the image above to access the Web Application.

                <p>While working at Braskem S.A. in the Legal Efficiency department, I developed Power BI dashboards to track KPIs related to legal operations. These dashboards provided real-time insights into company's current and past scenarios. By connecting it to a SharePoint database, I enabled the department to efficiently monitor and analyze their status. This project significantly improved decision-making processes and department's effectiveness.</p>

                <p>In my AI class, I worked on projects using TensorFlow and Keras. The first project involved building a deep learning model for predicting housing prices using the California Housing dataset. I utilized scikit-learn for data preprocessing and developed a neural network, optimizing the model with the Adam optimizer and evaluating it using Mean Squared Error. The second project was an image classification model using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model consisted on convolutional layers, batch normalization, and dropout for regularization. I improved its performance with data augmentation and learning rate scheduling.<br><b>Click on the image above to access the projects!</b></p>

                <p>Because I became a chess enthusiast during my Information Technology Master, I build a guide on how to build a chess engine. This guide consists on simple required steps in order to build your own chess engine. It focused on creating the basic components of a chess engine, such as representing the chessboard, generating possible moves, and evaluating different positions on the board. I choose algorithms like Minimax with alpha-beta pruning to help the engine decide the best moves by simulating different scenarios and outcomes. Throughout this project, I gained a deeper understanding of how artificial intelligence can be applied to the chess world.<br><b> Click on the image above to download my paper. Have fun!</b></p>
